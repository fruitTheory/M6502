Currently a 6502 microprocessor but working on PPU   
to emulate a Nintendo Entertainment System(NES), written in C  

## Features

- Full emulation of the legal CPU opcodes
- Emulation of primary system components I/O
- Support for NROM games, non memory-mapped
- Rendering of Sprite and Backgrounds

### Prerequisites

- A C 64-bit compiler (ex. GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2)
- Basic make and lib linking knowledge

### Building

```mingw32-make``` ```make```

### Running

```
./main path_to_bin or 'mingw32-make run'
```

## Roadmap

- ~~Implement primary opcodes~~
- Timings ~~and Interrupts~~
- Finish OAM and Nametables
- Refine components
- Streamline build
